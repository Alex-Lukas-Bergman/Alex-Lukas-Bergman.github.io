I am a PhD student at Lund university. My advisor is Alexandru Aleman.

My field of research is analysis. I am typically working in the intersection of complex analysis, operator theory, and Fourier analysis. Recently I have been interested in entire functions and their applications. Below you can find a list of some of my research interests.

* Banach and Hilbert spaces of analytic functions (Hardy, Dirichlet, Bergman, etc)
* Approximation problems
* The uncertainty principle in Fourier analysis
* Cyclic vectors and invariant subspaces
* Sharp inequalities and extremal functions (e.g. for entire functions, Chebyshev polynomials)
* Shift and integral operators
* De Branges and model spaces
* Canonical systems of differential equations (Including the classical Schrödinger, Dirac, Jacobi, and Krein strings)
* The non-linear Fourier transform
* Reproducing kernels
